# Principles
I will try to keep the following principles while working on this project

- ### Beginner friendly, but give options to dig in
    - Privacy is like a immunity. The more people who put effort to protect their privacy, the less vulnerable our society becomes. We want more people to care about their privacy.
    - For those who want to take a few extra steps, links will be provided in [extra materials](#) page.

- ### Easy integration in life
    - Protecting privacy should not be too difficult. Everyone can start with small changes.

- ### Low/No financial cost
    - Privacy should be sustainable. Also, buying a few privacy products is not the solution to privacy issues.

- ### Engaging/Relatable
    - Privacy is a progress. We should understand the importance of privacy and consistently work it. It is important to make materials interesting and easy to understand.

- ### No fearmongering
    - Fear often leads us to make unreasonable decisions, and those who benefit from it are salespeople of "privacy" products.
    - Fear may cause us to burnout and stop us from putting further efforts.
