#### Device Fingerprinting
Wikipedia defines device fingerprint as the following:
> A **device fingerprint** or *machine fingerprint* is information collected about the software and hardware of a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. The information is usually assimilated into a brief identifier using a fingerprinting algorithm. A **browser fingerprint** is information collected specifically by interaction with the web browser of the device.

Similar to how we leave our fingerprints all over the objects we touch, we leave our device fingerprint on web pages which we interact with - even when we use 'private' or 'incognito' mode in our browsers. To test how safe your browser is from fingerprinting, visit [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).
