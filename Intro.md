#### One way to define the privacy
Privacy is the right to decide the property of our own data of any kind.  
The property of data includes, but is not limited to, the following:
- Content     : What data do I want to share? How much do I want to share?
- Flow        : Where do I want my data be? To whom do I want to give access to my data?
- Purpose     : For what purpose should my data be used?

For example, consider the following scenario: 
> I went to see a doctor because I felt sick. My doctor reviewed my health history to understand my condition better. I talked about my day in the meantime. After doctor diagnosed my body, he/she wrote a prescription so pharmacies could provide my medication.

In the above scenario, my privacy was not violated. I wanted *my health data* to be handled by *my doctor* so he/she can *judge my condition better*. Also, I wanted my doctor to *share the processed data* in the form of prescription so that I have *access to medications*. I did not lose the control over my data, and it was used in the way I wanted.  
However, hypothetically, if my doctor has shared my health information with third party insurance companies, it will be a completely different story. I don't want my health data to be sold, and I don't want those data in the hands of insurance companies. In fact, I don't even want them to know that I visited my doctor. In this case, because I could not decide the properties of my own data, my privacy is violated.
