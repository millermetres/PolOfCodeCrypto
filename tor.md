### What is Tor?
From [Tor Project Support Page](https://support.torproject.org/):
> The name "Tor" can refer to several different components.
>
>Tor is a program you can run on your computer that helps keep you safe on the Internet. It protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. This set of volunteer relays is called the Tor network.
>
>The way most people use Tor is with Tor Browser, which is a version of Firefox that fixes many privacy issues. You can read more about Tor on our about page.
>
>The Tor Project is a non-profit (charity) organization that maintains and develops the Tor software.

To know more about the Tor project and/or to download the Tor browser, visit [this page](https://www.torproject.org/).


### Is Tor legal in UAE?

Because the law is unclear, be cautious using Tor within UAE outside of NYUAD campus.

The UAE Cybercrime Law No 5 of 2012 states:
> Whoever uses a fraudulent computer network protocol address (IP address) by using a false address or a third-party address by any other means *for the purpose of committing a crime or preventing its discovery*, shall be punished by temporary imprisonment and a fine of no less than Dh500,000 and not exceeding Dh2,000,000, or either of these two penalties. 

Because Tor aims to anonymize identities of Tor users, it seems **risky** to use Tor within UAE.  
However, using Tor for academic purpose within NYUAD campus seems safe (Needs source)
