Wikipedia Definition

<br><br>
<blockquote>
A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.

<blockquote>
A VPN is a tunnel connecting two different networks. You throw traffic into one end of the tunnel, and it will come out somewhere else, even if the destination might not be reachable on the public internet. VPNs are popular in company environments: Imagine a large company running their servers with private sale data on them. The company does not want those servers to be reachable via the internet for security reasons, but at the same time, salespeople need to be able to access those datasets, even if they are on the road. The salesperson can use the company’s VPN to “move their laptop into the company network”, without the need to physically be there, so they have access to that information. In addition, network traffic sent over VPNs is generally encrypted, so even if the salesperson is using a maybe insecure network, the data is probably safe, if everything is configured correctly.
</blockquote>
Using a VPN means that you trust the VPN provider with all your Internet connections going through their computers.  
Generally, because you have many VPN providers to choose from (as oppose to your limited number of local Internet Service Providers), it serves their interest to protect user privacy or at least pretend they care so they attract more customers.

### Is VPN legal in UAE?
Regulations on VPN usage in UAE is complex. 

The UAE Cybercrime Law No 5 of 2012 states:
> Whoever uses a fraudulent computer network protocol address (IP address) by using a false address or a third-party address by any other means *for the purpose of committing a crime or preventing its discovery*, shall be punished by temporary imprisonment and a fine of no less than Dh500,000 and not exceeding Dh2,000,000, or either of these two penalties. 

Using VPN is legal unless the purpose of using a VPN is "committing a crime" or "preventing its discovery". For example, it is a punishable offence to use a VPN for accessing censored materials (blocked webpages, YouTube videos, etc) or using VoIP/internet-calling services (Skype, WhatsApp calling, etc.). On the other hand, using a VPN for academic purposes (in NYUAD) is perfectly legal. But, the issue is that it is unclear how the law will be enforced, as distinguishing the purpose VPN usage may require inspections on encrypted traffics.


### Warnings on Free VPN services.
The below issues are identified by [CSIRO study](https://www.icir.org/vern/papers/vpn-apps-imc16.pdf)
1. Third-party user tracking and access to sensitive An-droid permissions
2. Malware presence
3. Traffic interception modes
4. (Lack of) Encryption and traffic leaks
5. In-path proxies and traffic manipulation
6. TLS interception

You are most likely to lose more than you gain when you use free VPN services.

### Debunking VPN advertisements
Tom Scott's "[This Video Is Sponsored By ███ VPN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY)" on YouTube can be a good introduction.

1. A VPN does not make you anonymous.
2. In most cases, a VPN does not provide more security (including Military-grade encryption).
3. No log VPN is extremely difficult to achieve and is likely to be a lie. There is no way for you to verify their statement.

### What VPN can do (not always/depends on services)
1. Accessing private(meaning *internal*, nothing more) networks such as school and workplace networks.
    - Access [NYU VPN service page on NYUAD Student Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/services/technology-and-support/remote-connectivity-vpn/)
2. Encrypt communications when using outdated webpages & apps that do not use HTTPS protocol in public Wi-Fi.
    - But HTTPS is still required to prevent VPN providers from reading your communication.
3. Bypass geolocked content such as YouTube and Netflix videos.
4. Circumvention of ISP-level web blocking, such as VoIP and censored websites.
5. With a correct setup, a VPN can hide your IP address from destinating webpages.
    - VPN providers know your true IP address and destinating webpages.
    - Hiding IP address does not mean hiding your identity. You can still be identified with browser cookies and fingerprinting.
